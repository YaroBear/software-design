1. What did you essentially learn in this course about design?

Writing software is easy, but writing well designed software is hard. There is no single strategy that can tackle every problem, but there are some principles that can guide us to arrive at an elegant solution.  In general, these design principles are easy to understand, but they still require practice to be applied correctly.  Consistently using good design principles will help a developer learn what 'good' code looks (or smells) like in different situations.  

Feedback is also a critical part of the development process.  Feedback from the customer (or Professor in this case) provides confidence that development is moving in the right direction.  

Nick:  I tend to over-complicate things.  There were several occasions during the assignments that I would get off track chasing a solution we ended up discarding.  The daily feedback from Venkat was so important in keeping us on track.  Every time we took a wrong turn, the feedback would nudge us back in the right direction.  This kept small problems from blowing up.  It makes me think of some of the old assignments I've written.  Often there was some step I wasn't sure about early on in the development process.  This would lead me to implement a less than ideal solution because I wasn't quite sure about the requirement for that step.  I'd tell myself I'd go back and fix that little issue once I figured out exactly what the requirements were.  Sometimes that realization didn't happen until many more steps had been taken though.  At that point, the 'small' problem has propagated through much of the rest of the code and become much bigger.  Fixing what started as a small issue then required changing a large percent of the code.  It was frustrating, and as assignments got bigger I dreaded making changes and occasionally resorted to full rebuilds.  None of the changes we made during this class felt like that, rather it felt like every day we were making minor course adjustments while still moving forward.  Overall, this was much less stressful.

Automated testing provides another important type of feedback.  Automated testing gives a developer immediate feedback about changes to code.  This is crucial, because it shows the developer that the code written yesterday still works with the changes made today.  If any of the changes cause problems, the developer can immediately see which tests are failing and refactor accordingly rather than waiting for a user to complain that some function doesn't work right.  Feedback from the automated tests provides confidence that the code still functions as desired.

Nick:  This course was my first experience with Continuous Integration as well.  I found it very useful.  It was always nice to know that the build was still stable after changes had been made.  And I think it even highlighted some issues we had with tests that involved promises.  If I recall correctly, we had written a few tests for assignment 2 that involved promises, and they were all passing on our computers. But a computer that took longer to connect to the service would cause the promises to be rejected and the tests to fail.  The continuous integration showed us our tests were a little more brittle than we had thought.  



2. What are some of the general guidelines you would follow when designing?

- TDD: Test Driven Design

Automated testing provides a very beneficial feedback loop.  It immediately shows developers whether or not code is still functioning as intended.  This is a confidence builder because errors can be fixed as soon as tests fail.  However, it is important to note that TDD does NOT guarantee bug-free code.  Good design principles must still be followed, otherwise irrelevant or useless tests might be written.  TDD only aids the design process if used properly.  Developers must listen to their tests and pay attention to the 'smell' of the code.  Tests should be written in a way that guides the design process and documents what the code does.


- KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid

Code is executed by machines but is also meant to be read and shared with other human beings. Keep over-design to a minimum, sometimes the most elegant solution is also the simplest.  It is often easier to write complex code than it is to write simple code that accomplishes exactly what is desired.  It is important to remember that code requires maintenance, and that most of the time that maintenance will be performed by people who had part in the design process.  Because of this, the code should be written so it is "self-documenting".  Meaning it is simple and straight-forward enough that someone unfamiliar with it can read and understand how it operates without the need for excessive comments.  Well written tests can be very helpful making code self-documenting. 


-DRY:  Don't Repeat Yourself

The DRY principle is related to KISS.  Writing repetitive code goes against the idea of Keeping It Simple.  DRY refers to duplication effort as well as written code.  


- SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

Keep code modular. Group classes that belong together in the same module, and keep methods that belong together in the same class. Every class should maintain a narrow responsibility in the grand scheme of the software.  SRP states that each class should be responsible for only ONE piece of the program's functionality, and that responsibility should be encapsulated by the class.  Or, as Robert Martin puts it, "a class should only have one reason to change".  


- LSP: Liskov's Substitution Principle

Child classes can be directly substituted where a base class is used, and what is true of the base class is true for every derived class but not necessarily vice versa.  Inheritance can introduce unwanted coupling, so it is important to use it carefully.  Delegation can be a better choice than inheritance.  A good rule of thumb is to use delegation if an instance of an object wants to re-use a class, and to use inheritance if an instance will be used as a class.


- DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle

In general, it is good practice to remove dependencies if possible.  If not, they should be decoupled.  The Dependency Inversion Principle states "high level modules should not depend on low level modules"
 and "abstractions should not depend on details, details should depend on abstractions".  If concrete classes depend on each other, the dependency can be "inverted" by introducing an interface on which both the higher level class and lower level class(es) depend.  This way concrete classes can be made to depend on interfaces rather than other concrete classes, eliminating the tight coupling.  


- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It (yet)

YAGNI goes hand in hand with KISS.  Adding methods that are not currently required is not "Keeping It Simple".  


- OCP: Open Closed Principle

Methods should be open for extension but closed for modification.  It is important to remember that closure is "strategic", not "complete".  Meaning the program is not 100% closed


Each of these principles is important, and all should be considered while designing a program.  Often, these principles are grouped together and referred to as SOLID (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP) or DYSOLD(DRY, YAGNI, SRP, OCP, LSP, and DIP).  


Design Patterns can be beneficial, but should not be forced.  The design principles discussed above should still guide the design process.  Patterns should only be applied to address specific needs that arise during the this process.  The patterns discussed in this course can be classified as creational, structural, or behavioral.  Creational patterns deal with the process of object creation.  Structural  patterns focus on how objects or classes are composed.  Behavioral patterns deal with the interaction of objects or classes.  

Creational patterns include: Abstract factory, Factory method, Prototype, Singleton, and Builder.

- Abstract factory:
Individual factories that have a common theme are grouped together without specifying their concrete classes. The client software creates the concrete implementation, and uses the generic interface to instantiate concrete objects.
The pattern separates the details of the implementation from the usage of the objects and relies on object composition.

- Factory method:
Factory methods deal with creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object. This pattern tries to solve inflexibility when we want to change the way we instantiate an object without having to change the class.

- Prototype:
Similar to the factory method, the prototype patterns seeks to eliminate subclassing an object creator in the client application. Rather than using the "new" keyword when requesting an object, an abstract class which holds a clone() method, is implemented by any class that needs polymorphic constructor capabilities. The client calls the clone() method with a parameter specifying the concrete class that is needed, or by another means provided by another design pattern.

- Singleton:
This patterns restricts instantiation to just one or very few objects, which is useful for restricting actions to one object and forces a global state. An example could be a connection to a database. The implementation often involves one constructor method and a getInstance() method that returns a pointer to the singleton object. The main focus is to ensure only one instance is ever created, the single instance can be accessed easily, and that the singleton class controls the creation and restriction of the object.

- Builder:
This pattern seeks to ease the creation of objects which are build by the composition of other objects constructors tossed as its parameters. Object creation relies on another builder object which receives each initialization parameter and returns the constructed object all at once for use by the calling object.

Structural patterns include:  Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, and Decorator with Lambda expressions.  

Behavioral patterns include:  Chain of responsibility, Iterator, Mediator, Observer
