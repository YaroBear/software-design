synopsis: let's rework the tests a bit 

details:
should expose all neighbors of a current inner cell
let's rename this as
exposeCell should expose its neighbors.

For this test we want to make sure that when exposeCell is called,
it in turn calls exposeNeighborsOf. For this we can do the following:

var called = false;
minesweeper.exposeNeighborsOf = function(row, column) {
  called = true;
}               

minesweeper.exposeCell(1, 2);

expect(called).to.be.true;

This approach verifies exactly what we want to verify, that calling exposeCell calls exposeNeighborsOf.

Then, if a cell is already exposed, we can verify that exposeCell does not call exposeNeighborsOf, like so:

var called = false;
minesweeper.exposeNeighborsOf = function(row, column) {
  called = true;
}               

minesweeper.exposeCell(1, 2);
called = false;
minesweeper.exposeCell(1, 2);

expect(called).to.be.false;            

We can then turn around and write test for exposeNeighborsOf separately, like so
                                           
var list = ...
minesweeper.exposeCell = function(row, column) {
  ...store row and column into the list ...
}
              
minesweeper.exposeNeighborsOf(1, 2);

...expect... list... to have the neighbors of 1, 2...

After this, let's move on to tests for sealing a cell. Keep your focus on only sealing an unsealing. Then work on tests for sealing an exposed cell. Then exposing a sealed cell.

synopsis: good job so far

details:
Please address and remove the review notes I leave in the code.

A test contains three parts: Arrange, Act, Assert. Let's give blank lines between each of these parts (if any of these parts are present).

Good work so far.

Let's move on to a few more tests.

exposeCell cell out of row range.
exposeCell out of column range.

exposeCell calls "exposeNeighbor" on each of its eight neighbors.

exposeCell call on an already exposed cell does not call exposeNeighbor on its neighbors.

Also, write tests for this when cell is on top edge, right edge, bottom edge,
left edge, top left corner.

synopsis: let's start with simpler tests and less code

details:
In package.json, we should not run
"test": "mocha --watch --reporter min"

with watch. This will run the test and wait. And that will result in the CI hanging.

If you want to run in watch mode locally, that is fine. For this we can setup another script to run in watch mode. I have created a watchtest. To use this, run

npm run watchtest

We don't need to use module and requires. We will be running the code in a browser. So, the browser will pick up the files from the src and the test directory without needing require. I have fixed the code to work with browser and tests to run with Karma. Please do not run mocha directly on node. Instead run mocha on the browser using Karma. If you have questions about this, please drop me an email.

Now to the code review.     
                          
Let's start with simpler tests and a lot less code as well.

Please see notes in code.

synopsis: build setup 

details:
I have setup a build file for you and have integrated that into the continuous integration also-see build.bat in your repository root directory.

To install the packages, run 
npm install 
just once on the command line in assign1 directory.

Then to run the test, each time run 
npm test 
in the command prompt from the assign1 directory.

Please make sure that the build passes (all tests pass) upon each commit. If a build fails, please fix the build right away. Either make change to fix the build or roll back the code change to fix the build (and then try again once you figure out what's going on). 

Start with may be three tests and minimum code for those three tests. We will review that and move forward.
