synopsis: let's start with simpler tests and less code

details:
In package.json, we should not run
"test": "mocha --watch --reporter min"

with watch. This will run the test and wait. And that will result in the CI hanging.

If you want to run in watch mode locally, that is fine. For this we can setup another script to run in watch mode. I have created a watchtest. To use this, run

npm run watchtest

We don't need to use module and requires. We will be running the code in a browser. So, the browser will pick up the files from the src and the test directory without needing require. I have fixed the code to work with browser and tests to run with Karma. Please do not run mocha directly on node. Instead run mocha on the browser using Karma. If you have questions about this, please drop me an email.

Now to the code review.     
                          
Let's start with simpler tests and a lot less code as well.

Please see notes in code.

synopsis: build setup 

details:
I have setup a build file for you and have integrated that into the continuous integration also-see build.bat in your repository root directory.

To install the packages, run 
npm install 
just once on the command line in assign1 directory.

Then to run the test, each time run 
npm test 
in the command prompt from the assign1 directory.

Please make sure that the build passes (all tests pass) upon each commit. If a build fails, please fix the build right away. Either make change to fix the build or roll back the code change to fix the build (and then try again once you figure out what's going on). 

Start with may be three tests and minimum code for those three tests. We will review that and move forward.
