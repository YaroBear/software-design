synopsis: let's make a few changes 

details:
Just like in assign1, let's edit package.json to create a start script command to easily run the program.

Please see suggestions in code.

synopsis: very nice progress 

details:                    

Nice work.

Let's proceed to write a program that will read a file, run the code we have written so far. That's the UI (not GUI) part. Console app is quite enough.

synopsis: let's upgrade to modern JavaScript 

details:         
Let's use class instead of the old style (in assign1 I did not go there because the browser support is weak). Since we're running this in node,
we can make better use of modern JavaScript features.

I would start with change to the code and keep the tests passing during that time. Once the code is refactored, then change the tests to use modern JavaScript and the tests should keep passing at that time as well. In other words, one change at a time will ensure things continue to work.

Coverage:
Please fix the code coverage, we have code that has no tests.

Anywhere var is used let's use const if possible otherwise let.

Please use file naming convention of word1-word2-word3.js.

Let's get the coverage up and will take a closer look at the tests and methods.

Good work.

Please see suggestions in code.

Let's move forward to the next small step.

synopsis: let's rework the design a bit 

details:
Please address and remove the review notes I leave in the code.

Let's rework the design a bit. 
Let's create a getAssetValues method that takes in stock symbols and number of shares. Let it call the service's getStockPrice. Let getAssetValues return symbols, number of shares, and asset values based on the price it gets.
Once we write a few positive tests (one symbol, two symbols, three symbols), 
we can then write the following tests:

1. When one of the symbols is invalid
2. When request to get price for one of the symbols results in a failure.

I like how you created a new test suite for this. Good job here.

Good progress.

synopsis: let's revisit how we approach the design 

details:
Coverage:
Please fix the code coverage, we have code that has no tests.

Let's step back and revisit where we are going.
Please see suggestions in code. After making those changes, let's look at the next step.

We have calculateNetAssetValue. It takes prices and number of shares and returns the total net asset value (and should not depend on the service). That is cohesive, follows SRP, and good so far.

Let's think of the overall goal. Given a bunch of symbols and the number of shares for each we want to do two things:
1. Get the asset value for each
2. Get the net asset value

The part 2 is (almost) done and it does not need any more details that we already have. For the first part, we need to transform a list of symbol and number of shares to list of symbol, number of shares, prices, and asset values. For this we can do the following:

Pass a list with symbols and number of shares.
Use Sinon to stub out the getPrice method of service.
Let the stub return a canned integer value for the price.
We can start the first test with one symbol and 100 shares.
Then second test with two symbols...

Let's not worry about Yahoo URL at this time. Design with test the method that will getAssetValues for symbols, use Sinon to stub the dependency.

synopsis: good so far

Good so far.

Please see suggestions in code..

Please proceed to next few tests.

synopsis: good start, let's reduce code, keep an eye on YAGNI 

details:

Coverage:
Let's get the coverage report in there.     

Code:
We are not using Karma, so we should get rid of karma.conf.js.

Let's consider YAGNI. No need for logs.

Let's reduce a lot of code. At this time, we only need one function,
to get calculateNetAssetValue (and may be the convertDecimalToInteger, but
we need a better name for that function to tell its real domain specific purpose).
