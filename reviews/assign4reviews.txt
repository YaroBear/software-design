synopsis: very nice work 

details:

Very nice work, especially with require.all.

Nice work keeping the code DRY in Transformations.

Write a small main script that will create a player and in a loop will ask it to perform action, transform up say a half a dozen time.

Change package.json to easily run that code.

synopsis: let's honor SRP on Player 

details:
Right now player is taking on a lot of responsibilities. Let's reduce that and keep it focused on keeping the current avatar and delegating the action. The transform call should also delegate the logic to outside of Player.

Let's separate, likewise, the tests for action from tests from transformation.

We want to be able to add new avatars, change the sequence of transformation, etc. without having to change any code.
