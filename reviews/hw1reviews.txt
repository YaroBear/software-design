synopsis: a few more tweaks 

details:
1.
"This can be difficult to accomplish because typically the intended users of a piece of software are not the developers of that software." The user of the software generally does not care nor see the design. We need to change this line of discussion. Let's keep the focus on the design and the developers maintaining the design. The point of keeping focus on what is relevant is important and valid. The point that requirements change is true as well. There are a lot of good ideas and reasons in this paragraph. They need to be woven together differently than it is now to bring out the reasons clearly.

The second paragraph focuses on minimalism and graceful failure. Good.

Are there more things we could add to a third paragraph? Intuitive, fewer moving parts, less coupling/fewer dependencies, cohesive, modular (mentioned in part 3)...

2.
The second paragraph is very well written, excellent work here.

The third paragraph makes excellent points as well, good job here too.

Guidelines?

3. 
Please check spelling.

synopsis: good start 

details:       
1.
In the first paragraph, minimalism is a good thing to discuss, however, how does keeping it minimum results in fewer failures or graceful failures. If that were true, please explain or connect the two points.

The second paragraph deviates from the questions. Please remove. Then focus the second and may be a third paragraph on other aspects of simple design. Minimalism is one attribute of simplicity, there are more.

2.
Please start by setting the context about nature of software project and the cost involved. Then tie how different aspects of simple design impacts those.

3.
Nick: Please write in small paragraphs. There are different ideas and influences being discussed here, we can separate them into shorter paragraphs for better clarity. That may also help to see if some of the thoughts are related to better planning (and may be removed) rather than simple design.

Yaro: Please relate this to simple design in some way or we may have to choose a different example/experience here.
