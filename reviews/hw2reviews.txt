synopsis: good start, let's present some details on separation of concerns 

details:
Diagram:
Please show cardinality - the number of objects of that class that will participate in the relationship.

Let's show the class that will deal with GUI separated from the one that will deal with logic.

Text:
1.
Please show all the classes mentioned here in the diagram.

Good reasoning for the design decisions, nice.

We can remove most of the low level details from here, like specific properties and the code sample, not useful at this level of design.

Instead, let's focus on high level details, layers, separation of concerns, distribution of logic, state, GUI among classes.

2.
You may use any of these languages you like. You may switch to another language later if you like, but don't switch too frequently.

3.
Good.
